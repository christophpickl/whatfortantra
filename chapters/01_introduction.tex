\section{Introduction}

In case you answered the question "Tantra - what for?" for yourself a long time ago, then you will find many things in this book with a smile that have accompanied, or still accompany you along your path.
In case you currently ask yourself that question - in an alienated, skeptical or curious way, maybe with a tiny tingle like in a treasure hunt - then you will find here a possibility to dive into the subject without getting wet.

The following short texts are based on more than two decades of teaching Tantra. They are ordered in such a way that they form a loose arch: from the first considerations and doubts about "What might obstruct my path and how can I be of help to myself?" to "This is how Tantra could look like in daily life".

You can take in much of it spontaneously and simply start practicing on your own. If you want to redirect your life permanently and in a well-guided way towards a new trajectory, then you can also grant yourself a few days of tantric personal development.

Enjoy!
