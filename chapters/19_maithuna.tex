Maithuna.

\textit{"Finally free sex, some say, and it even has a spiritual cover on top of it! Tedious, others say. Who should be able to sit upright for so long? Maithuna! That's the thing with the different positions, isn't it?"}, some ask.

Oh... Maithuna... that's not for me. Everyone has to interact with everyone, and it takes forever. Where's the fun in that, others moan, but not out of bliss.

Maithuna means union, and that refers to all levels. It encompasses the body and the mind and points out a path out of the daily entanglements of the duality: To be willing to be one with all that is.

\textit{With all that is} entails emotions, hopes and also deeply embedded personality patterns, as well as physical pleasures such as desire, suffering (for example pain in my knee) and the magnificent, annoying, unnoticeable presence of my partner.

To try to explain what Maithuna is, without having experienced it first, inevitably has to fail. One cannot describe precisely the taste of an unknown fruit. And still there are moments where one tries to do the impossible, even if one knows better.

In 2013, during a Maithuna ritual of one of our more advanced groups, I became a witness of such moments. I couldn't resist writing down what I saw and astonishingly observed what was unfolding right in front of my eyes, in this silent room beyond time. I almost didn’t dare to breathe in order not to disturb this perfectly smooth surface of being. There was something going on that I couldn't put my finger on, and yet desired so much to hold on to: Permanently, like when drawing a heart on a window that one has breathed on.

When I wrote my PhD thesis one year later, I wanted to use this text at the beginning as my introduction. But I didn’t do it in the end. It was too intimate, and only few would have understood it. Maybe, just maybe, here is the right place to put it.

The sun is shining through the uncovered window, drawing a moving pattern of time on the honey-yellow wooden floor. Eighteen candles are distributed in the room. Everyone is placed next to another person. Groups of three or four sit next to comfortable mats. Every perceivable movement happens with attentiveness, just like in slow motion. Carefully picked music supports their inner and outer rhythm. There are quiet touches, mindful hands and open glances. Unconditional presence which doesn't need words is in the room. I hear laughter, sighs and cosy purrs. I see pairs of eyes which close and then melt into each other again. No need to rush, no goal is noticeable. Everything unfolds in a natural flow, as if time has stopped.

Later they will be asked how many hours they stayed in this state. Or, maybe even more likely, they will not be asked at all.

If anyone of them encounters inner obstacles, everyone knows that there won't be any attempts for rescue. Everyone is responsible for themselves and is a competent expert about their own needs.
Sometimes someone loses himself in a maze of his own resistances of wanting and not wanting. Then everyone trusts that he will find his path back to himself, in his own time. But they also don't give up on someone who is temporarily confused: They stay attentive, open hearted and relaxed. They don't take responsibility for each other, but keep their doors loyally open for each other.

The men don't have to prove anything. They have learned to follow the flow of the moment and to trust their body and mind. What is, is. What isn't, is not. There is nothing to correct.

The women neither show stress nor bias. They obviously feel good in their bodies, regardless of their appearance. Everyone is present in their very own sovereignty.

Sometimes there are moments of complete stillness, sometimes there is a firework of energy, giggles and hearty laughter, sometimes there are tears. The participants don't talk, except for the ritualising formulas.

Meditative states interchange with outbreaks of spraying ease. Minutes, or rather hours, of silent immersion, together or alone, merge in roaring waves of highly energetic interaction. Playful and always discovering things from scratch, they feel joy about all the innocence and sensations which are provided by their wonder-ful bodies. Later on, they will report about deep insights, the shimmering kaleidoscope of new emotions and behavioral patterns, which they could observe in themselves. What a liberating understanding to be transferred to daily life!

But in this moment, they seem to be totally in love and intimately connected with their randomly assigned partner. And while they are on the mat and the ritual lasts, they are indeed in love, united with themselves and the universe, sighing, laughing, crying and falling silent in astonishment.
The picture which reveals itself in this room is amazingly intimate, mysterious, and touching eternity, so I almost don't dare to look.

Something like this, I can imagine, is how awakening looks like.
