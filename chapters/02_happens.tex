\textit{For years, potentially interested people have constantly been asking us and have wanted to know - and please in advance! - what actually happens at a Tantra seminar. We have finally surrendered to that request and are revealing it: Here they are, the facts!}

When you decide to be part of a Tantra group, it will be like all of you are being invited to a \textbf{big buffet}, with tables offering all kinds of delicious foods and snacks.

Some participants will wait until they got offered something three, four or even seven times, before they modestly go for it. Others will immediately jump for it, as if they haven't eaten for weeks. Some participants will look at the offer, full of desire and longing. Yet, out of fear of making a fool of themselves while using the snail tongs, they will stay with their good old mac'n'cheese. Others will shove heaps of potatoes on their plates and whisper to their neighbor how much they would have liked the salmon steak instead. Some participants will spend their time feeding others, instead of getting full themselves. Others will pick the raisins from the cake and then feel convinced they grasped the essence of the take. Others will stick to water and bread (which of course will also be served).

And everyone - really everyone - will find a range of learning opportunities: To find their personal right amount in the current moment; to allow oneself the carefree enjoyment; to say "yes" and "no" to all the offers; to have the courage to try something new, something unknown for once; to learn how to use these snake tongs in a playful way in a mutual trusting encounter; to try out life in its full diversity; to understand that there is enough for everyone; to understand that only a conscious celebration will bring deep and true joy -all of this, and much more.

At some point, you will drive home, your whole being still vibrating from all the unexpected new tastes and flavors. Regardless of whether it was one, three or five days: You will take enough momentum, energy and inspiration with you to recreate your own new menu of life.
